## Description:
This project involves the creation of a full-stack application that manages game store data. The API-based database application will manage inventory such as games, consoles, and T-shirts and provide a mechanism by which users can purchase the products.
We are responsible for designing and documenting the REST API and implementing the controllers, service, layering, repository, Java data objects, and unit tests for this application.
